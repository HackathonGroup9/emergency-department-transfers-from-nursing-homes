## Minimizing Emergency Department Transfers from Nursing Homes

This application was developed over the course of 4 hours in collaboration with the University of Calgary Masters of Nursing program. It aids nurses by simplifying their decision process when a patient experiences a sudden change in condition, minimizing unnecessary transfers, and physician times. As a result, nurses are able to spend more time with their patients, and patients recieve a higher quality of care.
